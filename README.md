# University-Success-Analysis
# Capstone Project




**Overview**

The University Success Analysis Project aims to analyze factors influencing student success in higher education using a data-driven approach. By leveraging data analytics tools and visualization techniques, this project provides insights that can help universities improve academic performance, retention rates, and overall institutional rankings.

**Data Source**

  The dataset was sourced from a GitHub repository.

  Available in CSV and SQL formats.

  Includes information on student performance, financial aid, attendance, and extracurricular activities.

**Process**

**1. Data Collection & Cleaning**

   Loaded CSV data into Excel and SQL data into MySQL Workbench.

   Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

   Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing records.

**2. Data Analysis & Tool Integration**

   Connected the cleaned dataset with Excel, Power BI, and MySQL.

   Used SQL queries for advanced data retrieval and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

   Created data models and visualizations in Power BI.

**3. Problem Solving & Insights Generation**

   Defined problem statements related to student success.

   Loaded tables, performed data modeling, and created dashboards in Power BI.

   Developed interactive visualizations to analyze trends and insights.

   Took screenshots of SQL query results and added them to the analysis.

**4. MECE Framework & Presentation**

   Applied MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) methodology to structure the insights.

   Created a PowerPoint presentation combining:

   EDA findings from Excel and SQL.

   Visualizations and dashboards from Power BI.

   Query results and insights from MySQL.

**5. Final Report Compilation**

   Compiled all findings into a detailed project report.

   Integrated all elements, including EDA, visualizations, SQL queries, insights, and Power BI dashboards.

**Tools Used**

   Excel (Data cleaning, EDA, and statistical analysis)

   Power BI (Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation)

   MySQL Workbench (Data storage, query execution, and result analysis)

   GitHub (Dataset source and project documentation)

   PowerPoint (Final presentation and summary of findings)

**Key Takeaways**

   Regular student attendance positively correlates with academic performance.

   Financial aid and scholarships significantly impact student retention.

   Extracurricular involvement contributes to better employability and leadership skills.

   Data-driven decision-making enhances university success strategies.

**Future Enhancements**

   Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast student success trends.

   Expand the dataset to include more universities and student demographics.

   Develop an automated dashboard for real-time student performance monitoring.

**How to Use This Project**

1. Clone the repository and access the dataset.

2. Load the CSV/SQL data into your preferred tool (Excel, MySQL, Power BI).

3. Perform data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.

4. Use the Power BI dashboard for interactive analysis.

5. Refer to the PowerPoint presentation and report for insights and conclusions.
